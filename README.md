# Problem Statement and Agenda:

One of the applications of Time Series Forecasting is to forecast the opening stock prices, closing stock prices, volume of stocks to be traded etc. In this data driven world, many firms are trying to forecast the future behaviour of the stock market.In this project, I have the stock Avg price data of stock exchange for some time periods of 2000 through to 2021. We are going to divide our data into training and test, build our models on the training data, forecast for the test data time stamps and then evaluate using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) model evaluation metric.

The following things will be covered in this case study:
•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	ARIMA/SARIMA models (with and without exogenous variables)
